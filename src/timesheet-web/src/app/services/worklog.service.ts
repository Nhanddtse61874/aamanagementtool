/**
 * Central data access for the Worklog app.
 *
 * M8.4 / Wave 2 — the transport under the M8.4 methods is now GENERATED, in `../api/**`, from the API's own
 * OpenAPI document (`npm run gen:api`). Nothing in `../api/**` is hand-written or hand-editable: it is the
 * wire contract, and the only way to change it is to change the C# and regenerate.
 *
 * `rootUrl` is `''` (ApiConfiguration), so every generated call is a SAME-ORIGIN RELATIVE path (`/api/...`).
 * That is not cosmetic. `ng serve` (:4200) -> Kestrel (:5080) is cross-site, and a `SameSite=Lax` cookie is
 * NOT SENT on a cross-site XHR: login would 200, and every call after it would go out anonymous -> 401 ->
 * redirect loop. The dev proxy makes the whole app same-origin; an absolute `http://localhost:5080/...`
 * anywhere in this file silently re-breaks it. Never introduce one.
 *
 * The one exception to "generated" is `exportExcel` / `exportMarkdown`, which are HAND-WRITTEN blob
 * downloads. That is deliberate and is explained on those two methods: their routes return binary / raw text
 * rather than JSON, so the "Export" tag is kept out of `includeTags` on purpose and no method is generated.
 * They are still same-origin relative paths, and for exactly the same reason.
 *
 * WIRED, AND REAL:
 *   - M8.4 — auth, the week grid, Smart Fill, the cell write.
 *   - M8.6/T5 — the Backlog screen's transport: the backlog list / create / audit, the task list and the
 *     checked task update, and the four user + PCA lookups.
 *   - M9/P5 — EVERYTHING ELSE. The Task List screen, Reports (+ the two file exports), the backlog/task tag
 *     joins and narrow task writes, Users, Teams, Tags, PCA contacts, Templates, Holidays, Default tasks,
 *     Standup, the key/value settings store, Ops, and the active-team switch. There is no route left in
 *     `../api/functions` that this service does not expose.
 *
 * THE `of(...)` STUBS ARE GONE — M9 P7 swept the last four. Every method on this class is REAL, TYPED
 * transport over `../api/**`, and every screen binds the GENERATED DTOs. The vendored view models they used
 * to return (`models/worklog.models.ts` — `User` as `{name, active}` with no `id`, `getHolidays()` as
 * `string[]` where the wire is `HolidayDto[]`) are deleted: they could not express the wire at all, which is
 * why every write keyed by id was unreachable from them by construction.
 *
 * The convention that retired them, for the record, since it is why the class briefly carried two names for
 * one read: a real method was ADDED BESIDE its stub under a NEW NAME, and each screen's own task then swapped
 * its component over and deleted the stub it orphaned. M8.6/T6 ran it first (`getBacklogList()` displacing
 * `getBacklogs()`), M9 Phase 2 ran it for the rest, and M9 P7 swept the four stubs whose consumers had all
 * moved but which no single agent was authorised to delete. It is finished; there is no stub layer left.
 *
 * 🔴 DO NOT ADD A NEW `of([])` PLACEHOLDER HERE. A screen with no endpoint is a gap in the plan, not
 * something to hide behind a stub that silently renders empty.

  // CANNOT EXPRESS THE CONTRACT, in two independent ways:
  //
  //   1. It has nowhere to put `expectedVersion`. The only value it could send is `null` — and null is not
  //      "I don't know", it DELIBERATELY ASSERTS "I believe this cell is EMPTY". Against a cell that already
  //      has hours that is a lie, and the checked write 409s. Every edit of a pre-existing cell, every user,
  //      forever. (And `0` is not a safe stand-in either: under the five-case table it is a DIFFERENT
  //      assertion again, which either 409s spuriously or silently overwrites someone.)
  //   2. Returning `void` throws away the new row_version — which is precisely the caller's NEXT
  //      expectedVersion. STORE WHAT THE WRITE RETURNS; never re-read it. A read-back is racy: another client
  //      can write in between, and you would then hold THEIR version with YOUR data and silently overwrite
  //      them on the next save. That is the lost update this whole mechanism exists to prevent.
  //
  // So: `expectedVersion` is `number | null` and the caller MUST pass the cell's actual rowVersion when the
  // cell has hours, and `null` ONLY when it genuinely has none. The return is the new version.
  //
  // 400 (8h cap / holiday / weekend / >1 decimal) and 409 (conflict) and 404 (task deleted or not your team)
  // all arrive as HttpErrorResponse — they are the caller's to handle, not this transport's to swallow.

  // PEOPLE — the two lookup PAIRS behind the editor's Assignee and PCA Contact dropdowns.
  //
  // The split inside each pair is not redundancy. It is a permission boundary AND a lifecycle one:
  //
  //   - `/api/users` · `/api/pca-contacts`             the ACTIVE rows, in full  -> what you may PICK.
  //   - `/api/users/names` · `/api/pca-contacts/names`  id+name for EVERYONE,
  //                                                     DEACTIVATED INCLUDED     -> what you may RENDER.
  //
  // A departed assignee must still render her name on the record she is already on; the active list no longer
  // contains her, so the grid resolves names from `/names` and offers choices from the active list.
  //
  // 🔴 `/api/users/all` and `/api/pca-contacts/all` ARE STILL A TRAP FOR THESE FOUR CALLERS — but the reason
  // CHANGED IN M9 P2a, and the old reason is now FALSE. THE COMMENT THAT USED TO SIT HERE SAID THEY WERE "not
  // in the generated client on purpose", pinned out by a contract test
  // (`Admin_gated_list_is_NOT_tagged_and_so_never_joins_the_generated_client`). THAT TEST NO LONGER EXISTS AND
  // THAT CLAIM IS NO LONGER TRUE: both routes are now tagged and BOTH ARE IN THE CLIENT, deliberately, because
  // the M9 Users/Settings screens cannot list a DEACTIVATED row without them. They are exposed here as
  // `getUsersAll()` and `getPcaContactsAll()`, both marked [ADMIN].
  //
  // WHAT DID NOT CHANGE IS THE HAZARD: both are `.RequireAuthorization(AuthSetup.AdminPolicy)`, so an ordinary
  // user reading one gets a 403 — which takes the screen's whole forkJoin down with it. The BACKLOG EDITOR is
  // reachable by a non-admin, so IT MUST KEEP USING THE FOUR METHODS BELOW and must never reach for the `/all`
  // pair. `/names` exists precisely for that: it is how a DEPARTED assignee's name still renders on a record
  // she is already on, without an admin route.
  //
  // The guard did not weaken, it MOVED — from "the route is absent from our client" (a proxy, which never
  // stopped anyone with a cookie and curl) to `SettingsEndpointsTests.The_admin_gated_full_list_is_403_for_a
  // _NON_admin`, which asserts the property itself. See THE ADMIN CONTRACT block further down.
  //
  // All four below are OPEN, and all four are READS -> the plain `http`.

  // 🔴 THE ADMIN CONTRACT — READ THIS BEFORE CALLING ANY METHOD MARKED [ADMIN] BELOW.
  //
  // About thirty of the methods added in M9/P5 hit a route carrying `.RequireAuthorization(AuthSetup
  // .AdminPolicy)`. They are in the generated client ON PURPOSE, and that is a REVERSAL of the M8.6 rule the
  // class comment above used to state: until M9 there was no admin-only SCREEN, so an admin route in the
  // client could only ever 403, and `/api/users/all` + `/api/pca-contacts/all` were kept out by a contract
  // test. M9 BUILDS those screens, and they cannot be built without those two routes — only `/all` returns
  // DEACTIVATED rows, and "Activate" has nothing to act on without them. The old test is gone; the guard did
  // not weaken, it MOVED to `SettingsEndpointsTests.The_admin_gated_full_list_is_403_for_a_NON_admin`, which
  // asserts the security property itself rather than a proxy for it.
  //
  // An ordinary user calling an [ADMIN] method gets a 403 — and a 403 inside a `forkJoin` takes THE WHOLE
  // SCREEN down with it, not just the panel that asked. So:
  //
  //     🔴 A SCREEN A NON-ADMIN CAN REACH MUST NEVER CALL A METHOD MARKED [ADMIN].
  //
  // 🔴 AND THE CLIENT-SIDE HALF OF THAT GUARD DOES NOT EXIST YET. `ng-openapi-gen.json`'s comment describes
  // `core/admin.guard.ts` in the present tense; there is no such file as of this commit. Routing a non-admin
  // to /users or /settings today 403s them. Writing that guard is a LATER M9 TASK, and it is not this one's.
  // =====================================================================================================

  // =====================================================================================================
  // 🔴 THE TEAM FILTER — `teamIds`, on getTaskListScreen / exportTaskListMarkdown / getWeeklyReport /
  // getMonthlyReport / getStandupBoard / exportExcel / exportMarkdown.
  //
  // 🔴 AN EMPTY ARRAY DOES NOT MEAN "NO TEAMS". IT MEANS "ALL MY TEAMS" — THE EXACT INVERSE.
  //
  // The generated `RequestBuilder` serialises a query array with `explode: true` — one `?teamIds=` entry PER
  // ELEMENT (see `QueryParameter.append`). An empty array therefore iterates ZERO times and appends NOTHING,
  // so `teamIds: []` goes out BYTE-IDENTICAL to `teamIds: undefined`: the key is genuinely ABSENT from the
  // URL, not present-and-empty. And the server reads an ABSENT key as "every team the caller belongs to":
  //
  //     if (!http.Request.Query.TryGetValue("teamIds", out var raw))
  //         return ctx.MemberTeamIds;              // <- TimesheetEndpoints/BacklogEndpoints.EffectiveTeamIds
  //
  // (`GET /api/standup/board` spells the same thing differently and means the same:
  //  `teamIds is { Length: > 0 } ? teamIds : ctx.MemberTeamIds`.)
  //
  // So a screen that "filters to nothing" by passing `[]` does NOT render an empty table. It renders
  // EVERYTHING — every backlog of every team the user belongs to, which is the worst possible direction for
  // this bug to fail in.
  //
  // These methods therefore pass `teamIds` through VERBATIM AND INVENT NO SENTINEL. There is no value they
  // could send that means "no teams": a fake id (`-1`) is INTERSECTED away server-side into the same empty
  // set that already means "all". THE SCREEN must special-case an empty selection and render its empty state
  // LOCALLY, without calling. That is Phase 2's contract and it is not this transport's to fake.

  //    getMissingLogs().length. See `pages/reports/report-model.ts:statCards`. Do not go hunting for it.
  //
  // 2. DO NOT RE-DERIVE `daysLogged` FROM `dayTotals`. The server owns it (ReportAggregator.DaysLogged):
  //    the denominator is Mon–Fri MINUS public holidays, which the client cannot see. It used to be
  //    `rows.Count` — a list that only holds days that HAVE logs — so it moved with the numerator and the
